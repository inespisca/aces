## Aces

A React only app based in an app shown in the Japanese anime *Future Card Buddyfight Ace*, where Buddyfight (a card game) players can select who to challenge next for a fight. Below is how the app looks like in the animation.

The Buddyfighter card list (Info listed: Name of the fighter, World used and a photo of the player):

The Buddyfighter profile without clicking anywhere - it states the name of the fighter, their points in the competition and photo of the fighter):

The Buddyfighter profile after clicking to challenge adds a text saying "-Decision-" over the picture of the challenged fighter:

Despite being a project still in progress, you can see how it is going so far in [its deployment page](https://buddyaces.netlify.app/)

Technologies used:
* React
* CSS

Features:
* **Challenge button** - Works exactly like carts in market websites, however this time it counts the number of buddyfighters you challenge. It works! Feel free to play with the button as much as you'd like. After clicking to challenge a buddyfighter, said button will change and say to remove the challenge. The counter on top right will also change its number accordingly.
